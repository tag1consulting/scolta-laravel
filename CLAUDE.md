# Claude Rules for scolta-laravel

## Versioning (CRITICAL — read scolta-core/VERSIONING.md)

Each Scolta package versions independently, from its own git tags. Compatibility with scolta-php is expressed by the caret constraint in `composer.json`, not by matching version numbers with it. Adapters pin scolta-php via `composer.lock` within that constraint. This is a platform adapter — it depends on scolta-php, never on scolta-core directly.

### Rules

- **NEVER** reimplement scoring, HTML cleaning, or prompt logic. These belong in scolta-core via scolta-php.
- **NEVER** change `composer.json` to depend on `tag1/scolta-core`. Depend on `tag1/scolta-php`.
- Dependency constraint MUST be a caret constraint: `"tag1/scolta-php": "^X.Y"` (or `@dev` for development).
- All public methods SHOULD have `@since` and `@stability` annotations.

### Version management and -dev workflow

The `version` field in `composer.json` is always either a tagged release (`0.2.0`) or a dev pre-release (`0.3.0-dev`). See scolta-core/VERSIONING.md for the full workflow. In Composer, `-dev` prevents accidental production installs without an explicit `@dev` flag.

- If current version has `-dev`, **do not change it** — multiple commits accumulate on one dev version.
- If current version is a bare release and you're making the first change after it, bump to next target with `-dev`.
- **WARNING:** Never commit a bare version bump without tagging it as a release.

### Local cross-package development

To test against un-released scolta-php locally, run `composer config minimum-stability dev && composer require tag1/scolta-php:@dev` (the path repo then supplies the dev build). **Do not commit a lock resolved from the path repo** — it describes one developer's machine, and the CI lock guard rejects `dist.type=path` on every branch.

The lock does not have to name a stable scolta-php on a branch, and while the floor is `^1.2@dev` it cannot: no stable release satisfies `^1.2`. The committed lock names `dev-main` from Packagist, `composer validate` in CI keeps it agreeing with `composer.json`, and `release.yml` refuses to publish while it is a development version. That is the gate: scolta-laravel 1.2.0 cannot be released before scolta-php 1.2.0 exists. Drop the `@dev` suffix from the constraint and re-lock when it does.

### Laravel conventions

- Follow Laravel package conventions: service provider, publishable config/views/migrations.
- Controllers are invokable (single `__invoke` method).
- Use Laravel's Cache, Process, Http facades — not raw PHP equivalents.
- Models use the `Searchable` trait pattern (similar to Scout).
- Config values should read from `env()` with sensible defaults.

## Testing

- Run: `./vendor/bin/phpunit`
- Tests use plain PHPUnit (not Orchestra Testbench) for speed.
- ConfigTest requires a minimal `Illuminate\Foundation\Application` for `storage_path()`/`public_path()`.
- All tests should pass in CI without any native runtime.

## Documentation Rules

Documentation follows code. When a PR changes behavior, the same PR must update the relevant docs.

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Every PR that changes code (not docs-only) MUST add an entry under `## [Unreleased]`. CI enforces this.
- **README.md**: Update if the change affects installation, Artisan commands, API endpoints, Searchable trait, or configuration.
- **config/scolta.php**: Published config file MUST have inline comments explaining each setting.
- **PHPDoc**: All public methods SHOULD have complete PHPDoc including `@since` and `@stability`.
